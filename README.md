# boky-s_bookstore

A simple fullstack application which uses Node JS, Vue JS, and Express.js to bring you a lovely little emulation of itbooks.store/'s API.

Dependencies:
node
mysql

Guide to running the app:
run the included "database.sql" after you've installed mysql on your pc 
to populate the database.

clone the repo, 
inside of boky-s_bookstore/
run "npm run dev"
and
inside of boky-s_bookstore/bookApp
run "npm run dev"

The interface will now be running on localhost:9000!

Todo: 
input validation
api scraper to populate with more books from itbooks (JSONtoDB function expansion)
more CRUD
Hosting on my VPS
etc...
